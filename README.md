# Overview

I attempted to learn more about how the structure of Java works and to get better at using files.

I developed a todo list that saves changes you make to it.

I want to start working with databases and Java next stretch, so working with text files is a good start.

Provide a link to your YouTube demonstration.  It should be a 4-5 minute demo of the software running and a walkthrough of the code.  Focus should be on sharing what you learned about the language syntax.
